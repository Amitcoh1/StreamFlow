# StreamFlow PyPI Publishing Guide

## Package Preparation Complete ✅

Your StreamFlow package has been successfully prepared and built for PyPI publication. The following files are ready for upload:

- `dist/streamflow-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel distribution)
- `dist/streamflow-1.0.0.tar.gz` (source distribution)

Both packages have passed twine's validation checks.

## Next Steps for PyPI Publishing

### 1. Create PyPI Account

1. Go to [PyPI.org](https://pypi.org/account/register/)
2. Create a new account
3. Verify your email address

### 2. Set Up API Token

1. Go to [PyPI Account Settings](https://pypi.org/manage/account/)
2. Scroll down to "API tokens"
3. Click "Add API token"
4. Give it a name (e.g., "StreamFlow Upload")
5. Set scope to "Entire account" for now
6. Copy the generated token (starts with `pypi-`)

### 3. Configure Twine

Create a `.pypirc` file in your home directory:

```ini
[distutils]
index-servers = pypi

[pypi]
username = __token__
password = pypi-YOUR_API_TOKEN_HERE
```

### 4. Test Upload (Recommended)

First, test with TestPyPI:

1. Create account at [TestPyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/)
2. Get API token from TestPyPI
3. Upload to test:

```bash
python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

### 5. Production Upload

Once tested, upload to production PyPI:

```bash
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```
