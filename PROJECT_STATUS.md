## 🔄 Code Review & Refactoring Summary

### Applied Clean Code Principles:
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each service has a single, well-defined purpose
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Services are open for extension but closed for modification
3. **Dependency Inversion**: High-level modules don't depend on low-level modules
4. **Interface Segregation**: Specific interfaces for different concerns
5. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Shared components for common functionality

### Design Patterns Implemented:
1. **Factory Pattern**: Notification channel creation in alerting service
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different notification strategies
3. **Observer Pattern**: Dashboard update notifications
4. **Repository Pattern**: Data access layer abstraction
5. **Dependency Injection**: Service dependencies managed through FastAPI
6. **Command Pattern**: Event processing commands
7. **Chain of Responsibility**: Request processing pipeline

### Architectural Improvements:
1. **Microservices**: Proper service boundaries and communication
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Asynchronous event processing
3. **Clean Architecture**: Separation of concerns and dependency management
4. **Domain-Driven Design**: Rich domain models and business logic
5. **CQRS**: Separate read and write models where appropriate
